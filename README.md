# WellTrack Mobile App

This repository contains the original Android implementation and a new React Native prototype located in `react-native/`. The React Native version uses Firebase for authentication and data storage and lays the groundwork for future fitness tracking features.

## React Native Features

- Email signup/login via Firebase Auth
- Onboarding form to collect goals and fitness level
- Dashboard screen fetching user settings from Firestore

Follow the instructions in `react-native/README.md` to run the prototype.
