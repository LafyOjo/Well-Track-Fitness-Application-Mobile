Key pointers:

When switching from user status from free to premium, notice the workout packs are still
'locked' this is because they have not officially enrolled in that workout pack, being a premium
user grants you permission to enroll in both free and premium workout packs. Once the user
has enrolled as a premium user, they will be able to access the premium workout packs that were initially
locked when they were a free user.
